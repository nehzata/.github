# Hi!

Long story short I wanted to donate to open source projects. I added an "Open source support fees" line item on my invoices and a few of my clients didn't bat an eyelid (I had awesome clients). 

I then realised I had to figure out how to distribute the funds, which sent me down a rabbit hole that is now called thanks.dev. I'm now able to donate $1k / mo across 1,200+ projects with money distributing to 320 of them! More details [here](https://thanks.dev/why).

I've managed to partner with [Sentry](https://thanks.dev/p/gh/getsentry), [Sourcegraph](https://thanks.dev/p/gh/sourcegraph) & [Square](https://thanks.dev/p/gh/cashapp) for an upcoming launch and would love to hear from you – please do reach out.

Regards,  
Ali
